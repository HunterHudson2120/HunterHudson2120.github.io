        <p class="para">The things that I like to do in my free time include, soccer, karate, coding, video games, and a lot of legos. I've been playing soccer and doing karate since I was four. I am a goalie along with being a blue belt in isshinryu karate which is Japanese. I've been coding for about three years. I mainly code websites using HTML and CSS, wanting to persue it into college. When I have the money to buy LEGOS, normally, the sets that I buy are cars. </p>
